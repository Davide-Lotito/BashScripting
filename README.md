A collection, which I will make over time, of scripts in Bash to automate some steps.

* wifi.sh : allows you to turn on / off the wifi network card (Super+W)
* equalString.sh : easy script to check if two strings are equal or not
* postCode.sh : automates the process of publishing your code on GitHub
* publicIP.sh : shows your public IP
* exportArchive.sh : brings together all the commands for extracting archives with format (zip/tar/tar.gz/tar.bz2/7z/gz)
