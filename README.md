# BashScripting [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/Davide-Lotito/BashScripting/blob/master/LICENSE)
A collection, which I will make over time, of scripts in Bash to automate some steps.

* wifi.sh : allows you to turn on / off the wifi network card (Super+W)
* equalString.sh : An easy script to check if two strings are equal or not
